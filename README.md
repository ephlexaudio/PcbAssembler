# PcbAssembler

Hand-soldering components on a circuit board can be a long, tedious process, especially when you have a lot of components, some of which are used in multiple places on the board. I got tired of this and created the PCB Assembler to make the task quicker and easier. I use Eagle to do circuit board design and layout. I export three files from Eagle: a bill of materials (which has one line for each component value), an image file (PNG which I convert to GIF), and a Fabmaster file, which contains the coordinates of all component locations.  For a screenshot go to the website given above.
